# Project Vision

## Problem
- Incomplete feedback loop for suspicious matter reporting - entites get no confirmation of their reported suspicions
- Incomplete data - entities are isolated and Austrac only gets some data
- Binary thresholds - not intelligent
- Can't identify 

## Solution
- Financial institutions to report all transactions and associated profiles to Austrac
- Austrac would use an AI to identify suspicious transactions; and from there identify suspicious entities or entities that are suspected to be part of a network (organised crime)

## Feasibility
- Cost vs benefit for reporting entities
  - No more SMRs
  - Lower cost
